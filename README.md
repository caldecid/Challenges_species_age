R scripts for the paper "Challenges in estimating species age from phylogenetic trees"

Here we provide the R scripts with the protocols of the simulations we implemented and the functions we used to run each of them. The repository's folders are structured to reflect the methodological section of the referred paper: 

* "error_equating_phylo_and_species_age" corresponds to the "Error in equating phylogenetic and species age" section.
* "impact_comparing_species" corresponds to the "Impact of age error in comparing species ages" section.
* "uniform_incomplete_sampling" corresponds to the "Error in the phylogenetic age due to uniform incomplete sampling" section. 
* "probabilistic_estimator" corresponds to the "A probabilistic method to infer species age" section.
* "age_dependent_extinction" corresponds to the "Simulation of age-dependent species extinction risks" section.
* "Functions" corresponds to the main and auxiliary functions used during the experiments.
